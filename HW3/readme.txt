HW3_2.m
just use [x1, x2, A, b] = HW3_2([],[]) to get the results of gradient decent method and normal equation respectively

HW3_3.m
just use [q3_4_1, q3_4_2] = HW3_3(eps), where eps can be 1e-4 or 1e-9, to get the Q matrices of different eps with classical Gram-Schmidt and the modified
Gram-Schmidt

HW3_4.m
just use [x3_1, x3_2, x4_1, x4_2, k1, k2] = HW3_4, to get the result of Q3.1, Q3.3 and Q3.4

HW3_5.m
just run it to get the result of each step
